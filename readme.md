## ‚úÖ Closed Issues and Fixes

This repository documents five tracked and resolved issues, each with corresponding application code updates and tests:

1. **[#9 - Verification Token Not Being Sent in Email](https://github.com/srikargoud2002/event_manager/issues/9)**  
   Issue involved missing token in the verification email sent to new users. Fixed by injecting `verification_token` in the template context. Now Manual verification also possible.

2. **[#7 - Login Page Fix](https://github.com/srikargoud2002/event_manager/issues/7)**  
   Resolved a frontend/backend mismatch that prevented successful login, due to incorrect form handling, made the change to take user input of email instead of username. and also the **example which is said in the video is fixed here now both show the same for easier testing(Registration and LogiN)**.

6. **[#1 - Mismatched Data in Login and Register](https://github.com/srikargoud2002/event_manager/issues/1)**

All fixes were tested and merged into the `main` branch using GitHub‚Äôs pull request workflow.

## üìö Reflection

This project helped me connect theory with real-world API development. I learned a lot about FastAPI, async database handling, and Pydantic validation. Debugging user issues and setting up CI/CD with Docker and GitHub Actions gave me hands-on experience with secure, maintainable deployments. These skills will be valuable for future team projects and industry work.
